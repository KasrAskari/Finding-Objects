# Finding Objects with OpenCV

## Overview  
This project implements **object detection** using **OpenCV**, utilizing techniques like **SIFT**, **FLANN**, **RANSAC**, and **Homography** to locate objects within images. The goal is to identify key features and match them across different images for accurate object localization.

## Features  
- **Key Feature Matching:** Uses SIFT for extracting and matching features.  
- **Robust Model:** FLANN and RANSAC for fast and reliable matching.  
- **Object Localization:** Applies Homography for accurate object detection.  
- **Interactive Code:** Includes Jupyter Notebook for hands-on experimentation.

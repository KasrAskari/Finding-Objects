# 🔍 Finding Objects with OpenCV  

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates **object detection** using **OpenCV**, employing feature-matching techniques such as **SIFT**, **FLANN**, **RANSAC**, and **Homography**. The objective is to extract key features from an image and match them against another to achieve **accurate object localization**.

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Feature Extraction & Matching** – Uses **SIFT** to detect and match key points across images.  
✅ **Robust Matching Algorithm** – Implements **FLANN** and **RANSAC** for precise and efficient feature matching.  
✅ **Object Localization** – Utilizes **Homography** to determine the object's position in different images.  
✅ **Interactive Experimentation** – Includes a **Jupyter Notebook** for hands-on testing and visualization.
